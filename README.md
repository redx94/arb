# Arbitrage Trading System (arb)

An optimized arbitrage trading contract and deployment framework designed for minimal gas costs and robust security.

## Overview

This project provides a production-ready smart contract along with deployment scripts to execute live arbitrage trades. It leverages best practices in gas optimization, security (via OpenZeppelin), and modular design to create a future-proof trading system.

## File Structure

- **contracts/ArbTrader.sol**: The main arbitrage trading smart contract.
- **scripts/deploy.js**: Deployment script for your smart contract.
- **truffle-config.js**: Configuration for deploying contracts using Truffle.
- **.env.example**: Example file for your environment variables.
- **.gitignore**: Git ignore configuration to exclude unnecessary files.

## Live Trading Setup

1. **Environment Variables:**  
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying `.env.example` and filling in your values:
   ```dotenv
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
   MNEMONIC=your_wallet_mnemonic_here
   PROVIDER_URL=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/your_project_id
   INFURA_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
   NETWORK=mainnet
   ```

2. **Contract Deployment:**  
   Deploy your contract using:
   ```bash
   node scripts/deploy.js
   ```
   For testing on a public testnet (e.g., Ropsten), update the `NETWORK` in your `.env` file accordingly and run:
   ```bash
   truffle migrate --network ropsten
   ```

3. **Post-Deployment:**  
   Once deployed, integrate and start your off-chain trading bot (if applicable) to interact with the live contract.

## Testing & Verification

- **Compile Contracts:**  
  ```bash
  truffle compile
  ```
- **Run Migrations:**  
  ```bash
  truffle migrate --network <network_name>
  ```

Make sure you have sufficient funds in your deployment wallet to cover gas costs.
